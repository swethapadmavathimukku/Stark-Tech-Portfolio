This first suit left a lot of room for improvement, but it still did what Tony couldn’t do <br></alone> <strong>"My armor, it was never a distraction or a hobby, it was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. But one thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man."
